## Required Software

- Gato Roboto from the [Steam Store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/916730)
- Archipelago from the [Archipelago Releases Page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)
- APWorld from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/AlexanderLeBlanc/Gato-Roboto-APWorld/releases)

## What does randomization do to this game?

Currently, the randomizer supports item and event randomization. There are also options to include skips and/or sequence breaks, such as **Rocket Jumping**, to vary the logic.

The default goal is to **Defeat Gary**, which is identical to the vanilla experience. Future plans for goals include **All Cartridges** and **100%**, to provide alternative and longer gameplay experiences.

## What items and locations get randomized?

By default, all of the following are randomized:
- Healthkits
- Cartridges
- Upgrade Modules
- Progressive Events
- Rebba's Shop

Visit the [options page](../player-options) for a comprehensive list of items and locations and what changes you can make to the game.

## What other changes are made to the game?

A few QoL improvements have been made to the base game:
- Starting a new game now places Kiki in the mech room, allowing the player immediate access to the mech suit
- Tutorial dialogs (intro, swimming, mech, etc.) have been removed
- All collectible item sprites have been replaced with the AP icon
